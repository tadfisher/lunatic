# Lunatic

A date picker view for Android, with three support modules that wrap actual date libraries and 
provide an API.

The date libraries supported:

- [`java.util.Date`](http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Date.html) /
[`java.util.Calendar`](http://developer.android.com/reference/java/util/Calendar.html)

- [Joda Time](http://www.joda.org/joda-time/):
[Android port](https://github.com/dlew/joda-time-android)

- [ThreeTen Backport](http://www.threeten.org/threetenbp/):
[Android port](https://github.com/JakeWharton/ThreeTenABP)

This project is very much a work-in-progress. In fact, you can't even select dates yet.
